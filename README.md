# About Grapht.ai
Grapht.ai is a computer vision program that aims to expedite the process for a dermatology referral, while providing data for dermatologists to learn from. Clients are able to upload a 'Grapht' and recieve immediate feedback on what our AI believes the condition is, and request a dermatologist referral. The Grapht is also anonymized and can be used for educational puposes in medical schools or at conferences. This provides a sustainable ecosystem for obtaining retraining data.
